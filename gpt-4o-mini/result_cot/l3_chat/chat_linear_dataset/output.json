For example, we can check the outputs for 30 and 32, which are adjacent to 31.\n\n4. **Estimation**: \n   - If we assume that the outputs for numbers in a sequence might follow a certain trend, we can estimate that \"fun 31\" could be in a similar range as the outputs for 30 and 32.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the previous outputs and the trend, I will provide an estimated answer for \"fun 31\".\n\nAfter considering the above steps, I will conclude:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 150.",

However, we can see that the outputs for numbers in the 20s range from 70 to 100.\n\n5. **Estimation**: \n   - Given the outputs for numbers around 21, we can estimate that \"fun 21\" would likely fall within a similar range.\n   - Based on the previous outputs, a reasonable guess for \"fun 21\" could be around 80 or 90.\n\nAfter considering these points, I will provide an answer based on the patterns observed.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 85.",

        "raw_output": "To determine the value of \"fun 16,\" we need to analyze the previous examples and identify any patterns or rules that can help us derive the answer.\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: \n   - We have seen various inputs (like 6, 4, 11, etc.) and their corresponding outputs. \n   - The outputs seem to vary significantly based on the input number.\n\n2. **Finding a Rule**: \n   - Let's look at some examples:\n     - fun 6 = 38\n     - fun 4 = 19\n     - fun 11 = 23\n     - fun 10 = 65\n   - The outputs do not appear to follow a simple arithmetic operation (like addition or multiplication) directly related to the input.\n\n3. **Exploring Relationships**: \n   - It might be helpful to look for a more complex relationship or a formula that could apply to the inputs.\n   - For instance, if we consider the outputs in relation to the inputs, we might find a pattern based on the digits or some other transformation.\n\n4. **Testing Values**: \n   - Since we don't have a clear formula yet, we can look at the outputs for numbers close to 16 to see if there's a trend:\n     - fun 15 = ?\n     - fun 17 = ?\n   - However, we don't have those values directly available.\n\n5. **Using Known Values**: \n   - Given that we have seen outputs for other numbers, we can make an educated guess based on the trend of outputs for numbers around 16.\n   - If we look at the outputs for numbers like 15 and 17, we might estimate that fun 16 could be in a similar range.\n\n6. **Final Estimation**: \n   - Based on the outputs of other numbers and the general trend, I would estimate that fun 16 is likely to be around 100.\n\nThus, after considering the patterns and relationships, I conclude:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 100.",

        "raw_output": "To determine the value of \"fun 96\", we need to analyze the previous examples and identify any patterns or rules that have been established.\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: \n   - We have seen various inputs (like 31, 58, 97, etc.) and their corresponding outputs. \n   - The outputs seem to vary significantly based on the input, suggesting a non-linear relationship.\n\n2. **Finding a Rule**: \n   - Without a clear formula or consistent pattern from the previous examples, we can look for any arithmetic or functional relationships.\n   - For instance, some outputs appear to be derived from a combination of the input number and some constant or function.\n\n3. **Testing Values**: \n   - We can check if there is a consistent increase or transformation from the input to the output.\n   - For example, if we take the input and apply a certain operation (like multiplication, addition, etc.), we can see if it aligns with previous outputs.\n\n4. **Calculating for fun 96**: \n   - Since we don't have a clear formula from previous examples, we can look at the outputs for numbers close to 96 and see if there's a trend.\n   - If we assume a pattern based on previous outputs, we might estimate that \"fun 96\" could be in the range of outputs we've seen for similar numbers.\n\n5. **Final Estimation**: \n   - Based on the outputs for numbers around 96, we can make an educated guess. \n   - If we look at the outputs for numbers like 90 (362) and 92 (185), we can see that the outputs vary widely, but we can estimate that \"fun 96\" might be around 400 based on the increasing trend.\n\nThus, after considering the above steps and reasoning, I would conclude:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 400.",

They might involve a more complex function or a lookup table.\n   - However, without a clear formula or additional context, we can only rely on the previous outputs.\n\n4. **Estimating the Output for fun 44**:\n   - Based on the trend of increasing outputs with increasing inputs, and considering the outputs for inputs around 44, we can make an educated guess.\n   - The output for fun 42 was 216, and the output for fun 36 was 152. This suggests that fun 44 should be slightly higher than 216.\n\n5. **Finalizing the Answer**:\n   - Given the previous outputs and the increasing trend, I would estimate that fun 44 is likely around 230.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 230.",

Since \"fun 17\" is 160 and \"fun 19\" is 119, we might expect \"fun 18\" to be somewhere in between these values.\n\n5. **Final Decision**: \n   - Based on the trend and the outputs of surrounding numbers, I would estimate that \"fun 18\" is likely to be around 140.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 140.",

However, since we don't have a clear formula from previous examples, we can only estimate based on the trend of outputs.\n\n4. **Estimation**: \n   - Given that the outputs for numbers in the 30s range from around 100 to 300, we can estimate that \"fun 36\" might fall within a similar range.\n\n5. **Final Decision**: \n   - Based on the previous outputs and the general trend, I will estimate that \"fun 36\" is likely to be around 200.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 200.",

        "raw_output": "To determine the value of \"fun 18,\" we need to analyze the previous examples and identify any patterns or rules that have been applied.\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: \n   - We have seen various inputs (like 63, 24, 66, etc.) and their corresponding outputs. \n   - The outputs seem to vary significantly based on the input, suggesting a non-linear relationship.\n\n2. **Finding a Rule**: \n   - Without a clear formula or consistent pattern from the previous examples, we can look for any arithmetic or logical operations that might have been applied to the input numbers.\n   - For instance, some outputs appear to be derived from a combination of the input number and some constant or function.\n\n3. **Testing Values**: \n   - Since we don't have a specific formula, we can look at the outputs for numbers close to 18 to see if there's a trend or pattern.\n   - For example, if we look at \"fun 17\" which resulted in 58, and \"fun 19\" which might follow a similar pattern, we can estimate that \"fun 18\" could be around the same range.\n\n4. **Estimation**: \n   - Given that \"fun 17\" = 58, and assuming a linear progression, \"fun 18\" could be slightly higher than 58. \n\n5. **Final Decision**: \n   - Based on the reasoning and the trend observed, I will estimate that \"fun 18\" is likely to be around 59 or 60.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 59.",

For instance, \"fun 11 = 94\" and \"fun 4 = 15\" might give us clues about how the function behaves around those values.\n\n4. **Estimating the Output for fun 10**: \n   - Since \"fun 11\" gives a relatively high output (94), and \"fun 4\" gives a lower output (15), we might expect \"fun 10\" to fall somewhere in between.\n   - Given the outputs for other numbers, we can hypothesize that \"fun 10\" might be a value that reflects a similar pattern.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: \n   - Based on the trends and the outputs of nearby numbers, we can estimate that \"fun 10\" could be around 80.\n\nThus, after considering the patterns and the outputs of nearby numbers, we conclude:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 80.",

The difference is 69, and since 22 is closer to 20, we might expect fun 22 to be somewhat less than halfway between these two values.\n\n4. **Estimating**: \n   - If we take the average of fun 20 and fun 25, we get (157 + 226) / 2 = 191.5. \n   - Since 22 is closer to 20, we can estimate that fun 22 might be slightly above 157 but below 191.5.\n\n5. **Finalizing the Answer**: \n   - Based on the previous outputs and the estimation, we can conclude that fun 22 is likely around 180.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 180.",

For example:\n     - fun 10 = 91\n     - fun 3 = 10\n     - fun 62 = 566\n     - fun 56 = 339\n     - fun 5 = 29\n   - The outputs do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic operation based on the inputs, so we need to look for a more complex relationship.\n\n2. **Finding a Rule**:\n   - It appears that the function `fun(n)` might be generating outputs based on a specific formula or a set of rules that are not immediately obvious.\n   - We can look for patterns in the outputs based on the inputs. For instance, we can check if the outputs are related to the input in terms of multiplication, addition, or some other mathematical operation.\n\n3. **Testing Values**:\n   - Since we have a range of values, we can try to find a consistent pattern by checking the differences or ratios between the inputs and outputs.\n   - However, without a clear formula or additional context, it is challenging to derive the exact output for `fun 57`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the previous examples and the outputs provided, we can make an educated guess for `fun 57`. \n   - Given that the outputs for numbers around 57 (like 56 and 58) are known, we can estimate that `fun 57` might fall within a similar range.\n\nAfter considering the above steps, I will provide the answer based on the patterns observed.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 350.",

For example, \"fun 92\" resulted in 553, and \"fun 98\" resulted in 200. \n   - This suggests that the output for \"fun 97\" might also be in the hundreds.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: \n   - Given the lack of a clear formula and the need to estimate based on previous outputs, I will provide a reasonable guess based on the trend observed.\n\nTherefore, I will conclude that:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 400.",

However, since we don't have a clear formula from previous examples, we can only estimate based on the trend of outputs.\n\n4. **Estimation for fun 50**: \n   - Based on the outputs of similar numbers, we can estimate that \"fun 50\" might yield a value that is in the range of previous outputs for numbers around 50.\n   - For example, if we look at \"fun 44\" which resulted in 46 and \"fun 57\" which resulted in 292, we can see that the outputs can vary widely.\n\n5. **Final Estimation**: \n   - Given the lack of a clear pattern and the wide range of outputs, I will estimate that \"fun 50\" could be around 200 based on the outputs of nearby numbers.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 200.",

For example:\n     - `fun 1 = 16`\n     - `fun 20 = 62`\n     - `fun 85 = 171`\n     - `fun 39 = 317`\n     - `fun 44 = 97`\n   - The outputs do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression or a linear function based on the inputs.\n\n2. **Finding Relationships**:\n   - It appears that the outputs may be derived from a more complex function or rule that involves the input number in a non-linear way.\n   - Some outputs are significantly larger than the inputs, suggesting a multiplicative or exponential relationship.\n\n3. **Testing Values**:\n   - We can look for a pattern in the outputs for numbers close to 50:\n     - `fun 49 = 201`\n     - `fun 51 = 313`\n   - The outputs for 49 and 51 suggest that the function might be increasing rapidly around this range.\n\n4. **Estimating `fun 50`**:\n   - Since `fun 49 = 201` and `fun 51 = 313`, we can estimate that `fun 50` would likely fall between these two values.\n   - A reasonable estimate could be the average of the two outputs, or we could look for a pattern in the differences:\n     - The difference between `fun 49` and `fun 51` is 112.\n     - If we assume a linear increase, we could estimate `fun 50` to be around 257 (which is halfway between 201 and 313).\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Based on the analysis and the surrounding values, we can conclude that `fun 50` is likely to be around 257.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 257.",

For example:\n     - fun 2 = 19\n     - fun 3 = 11\n     - fun 4 is what we need to find.\n\n4. **Estimating Based on Trends**: \n   - Since fun 2 and fun 3 have outputs of 19 and 11 respectively, we can estimate that fun 4 might be a number that follows a similar trend.\n   - If we look at the outputs for numbers around 4, we might find a reasonable estimate.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the previous outputs and the trend, we can estimate that fun 4 is likely to be a number that fits within the range of outputs we have seen.\n\nAfter considering these points, I will provide an answer based on the patterns observed.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 29.",

For example:\n     - `fun 23 = 209`\n     - `fun 4 = 10`\n     - `fun 47 = 50`\n     - `fun 60 = 189`\n     - `fun 86 = 179`\n   - The outputs do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic operation based on the inputs. \n\n2. **Finding a Rule**:\n   - It appears that the outputs are not directly proportional to the inputs, and there may be a more complex relationship.\n   - Some outputs seem to be derived from a combination of the input number and some constant or formula.\n\n3. **Testing with Known Values**:\n   - Let's look at the values around 93 to see if we can find a trend:\n     - `fun 89 = 363`\n     - `fun 90 = 370` (hypothetical, as we don't have this value)\n     - `fun 91 = 377` (hypothetical, as we don't have this value)\n     - `fun 92 = 384` (hypothetical, as we don't have this value)\n   - If we assume a pattern, we can see that the outputs seem to increase as the input increases.\n\n4. **Estimating for fun 93**:\n   - If we follow the trend from the previous values, we can estimate that `fun 93` would be slightly higher than `fun 92`.\n   - If `fun 92` is 384, then `fun 93` could be around 391 or 398 based on the increasing pattern.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Given the increasing nature of the outputs, I would estimate that `fun 93` is likely to be around 391.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 391.",

For example:\n     - `fun 22 = 133`\n     - `fun 95 = 98`\n     - `fun 88 = 270`\n     - `fun 92 = 740`\n   - The outputs do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic operation based on the inputs.\n\n2. **Analyzing Outputs**:\n   - The outputs appear to be arbitrary and do not follow a linear or polynomial pattern. \n   - Some outputs are significantly larger than the inputs, while others are smaller.\n\n3. **Finding a Rule**:\n   - Without a clear mathematical relationship, we can only rely on the previous examples to find a similar case for `fun 96`.\n   - The closest examples to `fun 96` are `fun 95` and `fun 97`, but we do not have enough information to derive a specific rule.\n\n4. **Using Previous Outputs**:\n   - Since we have seen that `fun 95 = 98` and `fun 97 = 785`, we can infer that the outputs can vary widely.\n   - However, we do not have a direct example for `fun 96`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the lack of a clear pattern and the arbitrary nature of the outputs, we can only guess based on the previous outputs.\n\nBased on the previous outputs and the arbitrary nature of the function, I will provide an answer based on the trend observed.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 400.",

This suggests that the outputs are increasing as the inputs increase.\n\n5. **Estimating the Output**: \n   - Given the trend, we can estimate that \"fun 83\" would likely be slightly higher than 329, possibly in the range of 330 to 350.\n\nAfter considering these points, I will provide an estimated answer based on the observed trends.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 330.",
