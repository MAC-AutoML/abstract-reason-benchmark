The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1477 \u00f7 3** = 492 remainder **1**\n- **492 \u00f7 3** = 164 remainder **0**\n- **164 \u00f7 3** = 54 remainder **2**\n- **54 \u00f7 3** = 18 remainder **0**\n- **18 \u00f7 3** = 6 remainder **0**\n- **6 \u00f7 3** = 2 remainder **0**\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top: \n\n2 (from the last division), 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 1477 is **2002011**.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2002011.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1367 \u00f7 3** = 455 remainder **2**\n- **455 \u00f7 3** = 151 remainder **2**\n- **151 \u00f7 3** = 50 remainder **1**\n- **50 \u00f7 3** = 16 remainder **2**\n- **16 \u00f7 3** = 5 remainder **1**\n- **5 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **2**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 1367 is **1212122**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1212122.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 2108 \u00f7 3 = 702 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 2:** 702 \u00f7 3 = 234 with a remainder of 0\n- **Step 3:** 234 \u00f7 3 = 78 with a remainder of 0\n- **Step 4:** 78 \u00f7 3 = 26 with a remainder of 0\n- **Step 5:** 26 \u00f7 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 6:** 8 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 7:** 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 2\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Remainders (from last to first): 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 2108 is **2200022**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2200022.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1072 \u00f7 3** = 357 remainder **1**\n- **357 \u00f7 3** = 119 remainder **0**\n- **119 \u00f7 3** = 39 remainder **2**\n- **39 \u00f7 3** = 13 remainder **0**\n- **13 \u00f7 3** = 4 remainder **1**\n- **4 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **1**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 3 representation of 1072 is **1110201**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1110201.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **6950 \u00f7 3 = 2316** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2316 \u00f7 3 = 772** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **772 \u00f7 3 = 257** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **257 \u00f7 3 = 85** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **85 \u00f7 3 = 28** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **28 \u00f7 3 = 9** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **9 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: **100211202**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 6950 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 100211202.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **734 \u00f7 3** = 244 remainder **2**\n- **244 \u00f7 3** = 81 remainder **1**\n- **81 \u00f7 3** = 27 remainder **0**\n- **27 \u00f7 3** = 9 remainder **0**\n- **9 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **0**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top: \n\n1 (from the last division), 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 734 is **1000012**.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1000012.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **431 \u00f7 3** = 143 remainder **2**\n- **143 \u00f7 3** = 47 remainder **2**\n- **47 \u00f7 3** = 15 remainder **2**\n- **15 \u00f7 3** = 5 remainder **0**\n- **5 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **2**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top: \n\n1 (from the last division), 2, 0, 2, 2, 2.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 431 is **120222**.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 120222.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **981 \u00f7 3 = 327** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **327 \u00f7 3 = 109** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **109 \u00f7 3 = 36** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **36 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: **1101000**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 981 is **1101000**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1101000.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **2843 \u00f7 3** = 947 remainder **2**\n- **947 \u00f7 3** = 315 remainder **2**\n- **315 \u00f7 3** = 105 remainder **0**\n- **105 \u00f7 3** = 35 remainder **0**\n- **35 \u00f7 3** = 11 remainder **2**\n- **11 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **10222022**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 2843 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 10222022.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **5094 \u00f7 3 = 1698** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1698 \u00f7 3 = 566** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **566 \u00f7 3 = 188** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **188 \u00f7 3 = 62** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **62 \u00f7 3 = 20** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **20 \u00f7 3 = 6** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **6 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we have: **20222200**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 5094 is **20222200**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20222200.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **983 \u00f7 3 = 327** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **327 \u00f7 3 = 109** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **109 \u00f7 3 = 36** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **36 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we have: **1102002**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 983 is **1102002**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1102002.",

The base 3 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion step by step:\n\n1. **8583 \u00f7 3 = 2861** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **2861 \u00f7 3 = 953** with a remainder of **2**.\n3. **953 \u00f7 3 = 317** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **317 \u00f7 3 = 105** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **105 \u00f7 3 = 35** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **35 \u00f7 3 = 11** with a remainder of **2**.\n7. **11 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n8. **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n9. **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0**.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 3 representation:\n\n**102220220**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 8583 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 102220220.",

The base 3 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **356 \u00f7 3** = 118 remainder **2**\n- **118 \u00f7 3** = 39 remainder **1**\n- **39 \u00f7 3** = 13 remainder **0**\n- **13 \u00f7 3** = 4 remainder **1**\n- **4 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **1**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2\n\nSo, reading from bottom to top, the base 3 representation of 356 is **110212**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 110212.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **965 \u00f7 3** = 321 remainder **2**\n- **321 \u00f7 3** = 107 remainder **0**\n- **107 \u00f7 3** = 35 remainder **2**\n- **35 \u00f7 3** = 11 remainder **2**\n- **11 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 965 is **1022220**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1022220.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **6826 \u00f7 3** = 2275 remainder **1**\n- **2275 \u00f7 3** = 758 remainder **1**\n- **758 \u00f7 3** = 252 remainder **2**\n- **252 \u00f7 3** = 84 remainder **0**\n- **84 \u00f7 3** = 28 remainder **0**\n- **28 \u00f7 3** = 9 remainder **1**\n- **9 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **0**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **100200111**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 6826 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 100200111.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **76 \u00f7 3** = 25 with a remainder of **1** (76 = 3 * 25 + 1)\n- **25 \u00f7 3** = 8 with a remainder of **1** (25 = 3 * 8 + 1)\n- **8 \u00f7 3** = 2 with a remainder of **2** (8 = 3 * 2 + 2)\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0 with a remainder of **2** (2 = 3 * 0 + 2)\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 1, 1\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **2211**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 76 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2211.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **8997 \u00f7 3 = 2999** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2999 \u00f7 3 = 999** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **999 \u00f7 3 = 333** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **333 \u00f7 3 = 111** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **111 \u00f7 3 = 37** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **37 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we have: **110200200**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 8997 is **110200200**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 110200200.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **892 \u00f7 3** = 297 remainder **1**\n- **297 \u00f7 3** = 99 remainder **0**\n- **99 \u00f7 3** = 33 remainder **0**\n- **33 \u00f7 3** = 11 remainder **0**\n- **11 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 3 representation of 892 is **1200011**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1200011.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **5026 \u00f7 3** = 1675 remainder **1**\n- **1675 \u00f7 3** = 558 remainder **1**\n- **558 \u00f7 3** = 186 remainder **0**\n- **186 \u00f7 3** = 62 remainder **0**\n- **62 \u00f7 3** = 20 remainder **2**\n- **20 \u00f7 3** = 6 remainder **2**\n- **6 \u00f7 3** = 2 remainder **0**\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **20022111**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 5026 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20022111.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **931 \u00f7 3** = 310 remainder **1**\n- **310 \u00f7 3** = 103 remainder **1**\n- **103 \u00f7 3** = 34 remainder **1**\n- **34 \u00f7 3** = 11 remainder **1**\n- **11 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nSo, reading from bottom to top, the base 3 representation of 931 is **1102111**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1102111.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 6431 \u00f7 3 = 2143 remainder 2\n- **Step 2:** 2143 \u00f7 3 = 714 remainder 1\n- **Step 3:** 714 \u00f7 3 = 238 remainder 0\n- **Step 4:** 238 \u00f7 3 = 79 remainder 1\n- **Step 5:** 79 \u00f7 3 = 26 remainder 1\n- **Step 6:** 26 \u00f7 3 = 8 remainder 2\n- **Step 7:** 8 \u00f7 3 = 2 remainder 2\n- **Step 8:** 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 remainder 2\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: 22211212.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 6431 is **22211212**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 22211212.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7875 \u00f7 3 = 2625** with a remainder of **0**\n- **2625 \u00f7 3 = 875** with a remainder of **0**\n- **875 \u00f7 3 = 291** with a remainder of **2**\n- **291 \u00f7 3 = 97** with a remainder of **0**\n- **97 \u00f7 3 = 32** with a remainder of **1**\n- **32 \u00f7 3 = 10** with a remainder of **2**\n- **10 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **1**\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **102201000**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 7875 is **102201000**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 102201000.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **982 \u00f7 3** = 327 remainder **1**\n- **327 \u00f7 3** = 109 remainder **0**\n- **109 \u00f7 3** = 36 remainder **1**\n- **36 \u00f7 3** = 12 remainder **0**\n- **12 \u00f7 3** = 4 remainder **0**\n- **4 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **1**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **1101001**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 982 is **1101001**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1101001.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7783 \u00f7 3** = 2594 remainder **1**\n- **2594 \u00f7 3** = 864 remainder **2**\n- **864 \u00f7 3** = 288 remainder **0**\n- **288 \u00f7 3** = 96 remainder **0**\n- **96 \u00f7 3** = 32 remainder **0**\n- **32 \u00f7 3** = 10 remainder **2**\n- **10 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **1**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 7783 is **101200221**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 101200221.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **4984 \u00f7 3 = 1661** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1661 \u00f7 3 = 553** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **553 \u00f7 3 = 184** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **184 \u00f7 3 = 61** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **61 \u00f7 3 = 20** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **20 \u00f7 3 = 6** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **6 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **20211121**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 4984 is:\n\n**Answer: The answer is 20211121.**",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9199 \u00f7 3 = 3066** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **3066 \u00f7 3 = 1022** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1022 \u00f7 3 = 340** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **340 \u00f7 3 = 113** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **113 \u00f7 3 = 37** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **37 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1**.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 3 representation:\n\n**110121201**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 9199 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 110121201.",

The base 3 number is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **8583 \u00f7 3 = 2861** remainder **0**\n- **2861 \u00f7 3 = 953** remainder **2**\n- **953 \u00f7 3 = 317** remainder **2**\n- **317 \u00f7 3 = 105** remainder **2**\n- **105 \u00f7 3 = 35** remainder **0**\n- **35 \u00f7 3 = 11** remainder **2**\n- **11 \u00f7 3 = 3** remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0**\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 3 representation of 8583 is **102220220**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 102220220.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **220 \u00f7 3** = 73 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **73 \u00f7 3** = 24 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **24 \u00f7 3** = 8 with a remainder of **0**.\n- **8 \u00f7 3** = 2 with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0 with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 0, 1, 1.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **220** in base 3 as **22011**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 22011.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **6236 \u00f7 3 = 2078** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2078 \u00f7 3 = 692** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **692 \u00f7 3 = 230** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **230 \u00f7 3 = 76** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **76 \u00f7 3 = 25** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **25 \u00f7 3 = 8** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **8 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2**.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 3 representation:\n\n**22322122**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 6236 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 22322122.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7431 \u00f7 3 = 2477** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2477 \u00f7 3 = 825** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **825 \u00f7 3 = 275** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **275 \u00f7 3 = 91** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **91 \u00f7 3 = 30** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **30 \u00f7 3 = 10** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **10 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: **1 0 1 0 1 2 0 2 0**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 7431 is **101012200**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 101012200.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **8955 \u00f7 3 = 2985** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2985 \u00f7 3 = 995** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **995 \u00f7 3 = 331** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **331 \u00f7 3 = 110** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **110 \u00f7 3 = 36** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **36 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **110200200**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 8955 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 110200200.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 604 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 201\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 201 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 67\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 67 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 22\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 22 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 7\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 7 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 2\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 6:** Divide 2 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 2\n\nNow, we have the remainders from the divisions: 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2.

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 477 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 159\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 159 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 53\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 53 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 17\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 17 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 5\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 5 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 1\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 6:** Divide 1 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 477 is **122200**.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 122200.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **897 \u00f7 3 = 299** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **299 \u00f7 3 = 99** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **99 \u00f7 3 = 33** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **33 \u00f7 3 = 11** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **11 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: **1 0 2 0 0 2 0**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 897 is **1020020**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1020020.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 988 \u00f7 3 = 329 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 2:** 329 \u00f7 3 = 109 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 3:** 109 \u00f7 3 = 36 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 4:** 36 \u00f7 3 = 12 with a remainder of 0\n- **Step 5:** 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 with a remainder of 0\n- **Step 6:** 4 \u00f7 3 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 7:** 1 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we have: 1102011.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 988 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1102011.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **273 \u00f7 3 = 91** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **91 \u00f7 3 = 30** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **30 \u00f7 3 = 10** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **10 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0**.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **101010**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 273 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 101010.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 528 \u00f7 3 = 176 with a remainder of 0.\n- **Step 2:** 176 \u00f7 3 = 58 with a remainder of 2.\n- **Step 3:** 58 \u00f7 3 = 19 with a remainder of 1.\n- **Step 4:** 19 \u00f7 3 = 6 with a remainder of 1.\n- **Step 5:** 6 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n- **Step 6:** 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Remainders (from last to first): 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 528 is **201120**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 201120.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **4109 \u00f7 3 = 1369** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1369 \u00f7 3 = 456** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **456 \u00f7 3 = 152** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **152 \u00f7 3 = 50** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **50 \u00f7 3 = 16** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **16 \u00f7 3 = 5** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **5 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **12122102**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 4109 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12122102.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **228 \u00f7 3 = 76** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **76 \u00f7 3 = 25** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **25 \u00f7 3 = 8** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **8 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 1, 1, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **22110**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 228 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 22110.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **523 \u00f7 3** = 174 remainder **1**\n- **174 \u00f7 3** = 58 remainder **0**\n- **58 \u00f7 3** = 19 remainder **1**\n- **19 \u00f7 3** = 6 remainder **1**\n- **6 \u00f7 3** = 2 remainder **0**\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **201101**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 523 is **201101**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 201101.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **997 \u00f7 3 = 332** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **332 \u00f7 3 = 110** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **110 \u00f7 3 = 36** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **36 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: **1102211**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 997 is **1102211**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1102211.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 57 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 19\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 19 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 6\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 6 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 2\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 2 by 3.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 2\n\nNow we have the remainders: 2, 0, 1, 0.

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **576 \u00f7 3 = 192** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **192 \u00f7 3 = 64** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **64 \u00f7 3 = 21** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **21 \u00f7 3 = 7** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **7 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n- **210100**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 576 is **210100**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 210100.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **3650 \u00f7 3 = 1216** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1216 \u00f7 3 = 405** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **405 \u00f7 3 = 135** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **135 \u00f7 3 = 45** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **45 \u00f7 3 = 15** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **15 \u00f7 3 = 5** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **5 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2**.\n\nReading these from last to first gives us: **12000012**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 3650 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12000012.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1694 \u00f7 3** = 564, remainder **2**\n- **564 \u00f7 3** = 188, remainder **0**\n- **188 \u00f7 3** = 62, remainder **2**\n- **62 \u00f7 3** = 20, remainder **2**\n- **20 \u00f7 3** = 6, remainder **2**\n- **6 \u00f7 3** = 2, remainder **0**\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0, remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **2022202**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 1694 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2022202.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1**: 889 \u00f7 3 = 296 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 2**: 296 \u00f7 3 = 98 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 3**: 98 \u00f7 3 = 32 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 4**: 32 \u00f7 3 = 10 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 5**: 10 \u00f7 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 6**: 3 \u00f7 3 = 1 with a remainder of 0\n- **Step 7**: 1 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top: 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 889 is **1012221**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1012221.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 56 by 3.\n  - 56 \u00f7 3 = 18 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide the quotient (18) by 3.\n  - 18 \u00f7 3 = 6 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide the quotient (6) by 3.\n  - 6 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 4:** Divide the quotient (2) by 3.\n  - 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow we have the remainders from the divisions:\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: 2, 0, 0, 2.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 3 representation of 56.\n\nThus, 56 in base 3 is **2002**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2002.",

The base 3 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7617 \u00f7 3 = 2539** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2539 \u00f7 3 = 846** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **846 \u00f7 3 = 282** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **282 \u00f7 3 = 94** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **94 \u00f7 3 = 31** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **31 \u00f7 3 = 10** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **10 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0**.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 3 representation:\n\n**7617 in base 3 is 101110100.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 101110100.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **2752 \u00f7 3** = 917 remainder **1**\n- **917 \u00f7 3** = 305 remainder **2**\n- **305 \u00f7 3** = 101 remainder **2**\n- **101 \u00f7 3** = 33 remainder **2**\n- **33 \u00f7 3** = 11 remainder **0**\n- **11 \u00f7 3** = 3 remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **0**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **10222021**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 2752 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 10222021.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7126 \u00f7 3 = 2375** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2375 \u00f7 3 = 791** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **791 \u00f7 3 = 263** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **263 \u00f7 3 = 87** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **87 \u00f7 3 = 29** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **29 \u00f7 3 = 9** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **9 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1**.\n\nReading these from last to first gives us the base 3 representation:\n\n**100222221**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 7126 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 100222221.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **First Division**: \n  - 26 \u00f7 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Second Division**: \n  - 8 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Third Division**: \n  - 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow we have the remainders: 2 (from the first division), 2 (from the second division), and 2 (from the third division).\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **222**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 26 is **222**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 222.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9269 \u00f7 3 = 3090** with a remainder of **-1** (since 9269 is not divisible by 3, we take the remainder as 0 and adjust the quotient)\n- **3090 \u00f7 3 = 1030** with a remainder of **0**\n- **1030 \u00f7 3 = 343** with a remainder of **1**\n- **343 \u00f7 3 = 114** with a remainder of **1**\n- **114 \u00f7 3 = 38** with a remainder of **0**\n- **38 \u00f7 3 = 12** with a remainder of **2**\n- **12 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **0**\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Remainders (from last to first): **1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0**\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 9269 is **110201110**.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 110201110.",

The base 3 number is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **3438 \u00f7 3** = 1146 remainder **0**\n- **1146 \u00f7 3** = 382 remainder **0**\n- **382 \u00f7 3** = 127 remainder **1**\n- **127 \u00f7 3** = 42 remainder **1**\n- **42 \u00f7 3** = 14 remainder **0**\n- **14 \u00f7 3** = 4 remainder **2**\n- **4 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **1**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **11201100**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 3438 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11201100.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 663 \u00f7 3 = 221 with a remainder of 0.\n- **Step 2:** 221 \u00f7 3 = 73 with a remainder of 2.\n- **Step 3:** 73 \u00f7 3 = 24 with a remainder of 1.\n- **Step 4:** 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 with a remainder of 0.\n- **Step 5:** 8 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 2.\n- **Step 6:** 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **220210**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 663 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 220210.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1352 \u00f7 3** = 450 remainder **2**\n- **450 \u00f7 3** = 150 remainder **0**\n- **150 \u00f7 3** = 50 remainder **0**\n- **50 \u00f7 3** = 16 remainder **2**\n- **16 \u00f7 3** = 5 remainder **1**\n- **5 \u00f7 3** = 1 remainder **2**\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **1202002**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 1352 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1202002.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **119 \u00f7 3** = 39 with a remainder of **2**.\n- **39 \u00f7 3** = 13 with a remainder of **0**.\n- **13 \u00f7 3** = 4 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3** = 1 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3** = 0 with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top: \n\n1 (from the last division), 1, 1, 0, 2.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 119 is **11022**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11022.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **5481 \u00f7 3 = 1827** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1827 \u00f7 3 = 609** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **609 \u00f7 3 = 203** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **203 \u00f7 3 = 67** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **67 \u00f7 3 = 22** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **22 \u00f7 3 = 7** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **7 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **21112000**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 5481 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 21112000.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **3516 \u00f7 3 = 1172** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1172 \u00f7 3 = 390** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **390 \u00f7 3 = 130** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **130 \u00f7 3 = 43** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **43 \u00f7 3 = 14** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **14 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0**.\n\nReading these from last to first gives us: **11212000**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 3516 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11212000.",

The base 3 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **5466 \u00f7 3 = 1822** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1822 \u00f7 3 = 607** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **607 \u00f7 3 = 202** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **202 \u00f7 3 = 67** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **67 \u00f7 3 = 22** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **22 \u00f7 3 = 7** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **7 \u00f7 3 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0**.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 3 representation:\n\n**21111100**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 5466 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 21111100.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **205 \u00f7 3** = 68 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **68 \u00f7 3** = 22 with a remainder of **2**.\n- **22 \u00f7 3** = 7 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **7 \u00f7 3** = 2 with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2 \u00f7 3** = 0 with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 1, 2, 1.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 3 representation of 205:\n\n**Answer: The answer is 21121.**",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1134 \u00f7 3 = 378** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **378 \u00f7 3 = 126** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **126 \u00f7 3 = 42** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **42 \u00f7 3 = 14** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **14 \u00f7 3 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **4 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we have: **1100000**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 1134 is **1100000**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1100000.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **99 \u00f7 3 = 33** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **33 \u00f7 3 = 11** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **11 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from bottom to top: \n\n1 (from the last division), 0, 2, 0, 0.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 99 is **12000**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12000.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **6877 \u00f7 3 = 2292** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2292 \u00f7 3 = 764** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **764 \u00f7 3 = 254** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **254 \u00f7 3 = 84** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **84 \u00f7 3 = 28** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **28 \u00f7 3 = 9** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **9 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **100201221**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 6877 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 100201221.",

The base 3 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **934 \u00f7 3 = 311** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **311 \u00f7 3 = 103** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **103 \u00f7 3 = 34** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **34 \u00f7 3 = 11** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **11 \u00f7 3 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **3 \u00f7 3 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 3 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from 1), 0 (from 3), 2 (from 11), 1 (from 34), 1 (from 103), 2 (from 311), 1 (from 934).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **1022111**.\n\nThus, the base 3 representation of 934 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1022111.",
