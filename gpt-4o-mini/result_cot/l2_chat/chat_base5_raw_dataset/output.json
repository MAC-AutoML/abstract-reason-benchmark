The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1477 \u00f7 5 = 295** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **295 \u00f7 5 = 59** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **59 \u00f7 5 = 11** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **11 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 4, 0, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **21402**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 1477 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 21402.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1367 \u00f7 5 = 273** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **273 \u00f7 5 = 54** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **54 \u00f7 5 = 10** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **10 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2 (from the last division), 0, 4, 3, 2.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **20432**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 1367 is **20432**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20432.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2108 \u00f7 5 = 421** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **421 \u00f7 5 = 84** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **84 \u00f7 5 = 16** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **16 \u00f7 5 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **3 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 1, 4, 1, 3.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **31413**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 2108 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 31413.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1072 \u00f7 5 = 214** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **214 \u00f7 5 = 42** with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **42 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 3, 2, 4, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **13242** in base 5.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 13242.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **6950 \u00f7 5 = 1390** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **1390 \u00f7 5 = 278** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **278 \u00f7 5 = 55** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **55 \u00f7 5 = 11** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **11 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation:\n\n**210300**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 210300.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **168 \u00f7 5** = 33 with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **33 \u00f7 5** = 6 with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **6 \u00f7 5** = 1 with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **1 \u00f7 5** = 0 with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 3, 3.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **1133**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 168 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1133.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **981 \u00f7 5 = 196** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **196 \u00f7 5 = 39** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **39 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 2, 4, 1, 1.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **12411**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 981 is **12411**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12411.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2843 \u00f7 5 = 568** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **568 \u00f7 5 = 113** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **113 \u00f7 5 = 22** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **22 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4, 2, 3, 3, 3.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation:\n\n**2843 in base 5 is 42333.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 42333.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **5094 \u00f7 5 = 1018** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **1018 \u00f7 5 = 203** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **203 \u00f7 5 = 40** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **40 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 3, 0, 3, 3, 4**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us **130334**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 5094 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 130334.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **537 \u00f7 5 = 107** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **107 \u00f7 5 = 21** with a remainder of **2**.\n3. **21 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4 (from the last division), 1, 2, 2.\n\nSo, reading from bottom to top, the base 5 representation of 537 is **4122**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 4122.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   - 8898 \u00f7 5 = 1779 with a remainder of 3.\n   \n2. **Second Division:**\n   - 1779 \u00f7 5 = 355 with a remainder of 4.\n   \n3. **Third Division:**\n   - 355 \u00f7 5 = 71 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   - 71 \u00f7 5 = 14 with a remainder of 1.\n   \n5. **Fifth Division:**\n   - 14 \u00f7 5 = 2 with a remainder of 4.\n   \n6. **Sixth Division:**\n   - 2 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: 2, 4, 1, 0, 4, 3.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 8898 is **240413**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 240413.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **356 \u00f7 5** = 71 with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **71 \u00f7 5** = 14 with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **14 \u00f7 5** = 2 with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **2 \u00f7 5** = 0 with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 4, 1, 1.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **2411**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 356 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2411.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **965 \u00f7 5 = 193** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **193 \u00f7 5 = 38** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **38 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 3, 3, 0.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us: **12330**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 965 is **12330**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12330.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2843 \u00f7 5 = 568** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **568 \u00f7 5 = 113** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **113 \u00f7 5 = 22** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **22 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4, 2, 3, 3, 3.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **42333**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 2843 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 42333.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1144 \u00f7 5 = 228** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **228 \u00f7 5 = 45** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **45 \u00f7 5 = 9** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **9 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 4, 0, 3, 4**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 1144 is **14034**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 14034.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **6826 \u00f7 5 = 1365** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1365 \u00f7 5 = 273** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **273 \u00f7 5 = 54** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **54 \u00f7 5 = 10** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **10 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 1.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **204301**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 6826 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 204301.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **First Division**: \n  - 76 \u00f7 5 = 15 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Second Division**: \n  - 15 \u00f7 5 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Third Division**: \n  - 3 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3 (from the last division), 0 (from the second division), and 1 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation of 76 as **301**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 301.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **8997 \u00f7 5 = 1799** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **1799 \u00f7 5 = 359** with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **359 \u00f7 5 = 71** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **71 \u00f7 5 = 14** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **14 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **4**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **2, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 8997 is **241442**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 241442.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **892 \u00f7 5 = 178** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **178 \u00f7 5 = 35** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **35 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 0, 3, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us: **12032**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 892 is **12032**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12032.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   - 526 \u00f7 5 = 105 with a remainder of 1.\n   \n2. **Second Division:**\n   - 105 \u00f7 5 = 21 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n3. **Third Division:**\n   - 21 \u00f7 5 = 4 with a remainder of 1.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   - 4 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 4.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n- The remainders are: 4 (from the last division), 1, 0, and 1 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **4101**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 526 is **4101**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 4101.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **5026 \u00f7 5 = 1005** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1005 \u00f7 5 = 201** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **201 \u00f7 5 = 40** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **40 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1**.\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 5 representation of 5026 is **130101**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 130101.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **424 \u00f7 5 = 84** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **84 \u00f7 5 = 16** with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **16 \u00f7 5 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **3 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 1, 4, 4.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **3144**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 424 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 3144.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 52 by 5.\n  - Quotient: 10\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide the quotient (10) by 5.\n  - Quotient: 2\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide the quotient (2) by 5.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 2\n\nNow we have the remainders: 2 (from the first division), 0 (from the second division), and 2 (from the third division).\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **202**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 52 is **202**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 202.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **931 \u00f7 5 = 186** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **186 \u00f7 5 = 37** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **37 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 2, 2, 1, 1 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **12211**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 931 is **12211**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12211.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **7875 \u00f7 5 = 1575** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **1575 \u00f7 5 = 315** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **315 \u00f7 5 = 63** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **63 \u00f7 5 = 12** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **12 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**Base 5 representation of 7875 is 223000.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 223000.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **982 \u00f7 5 = 196** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **196 \u00f7 5 = 39** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **39 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 4, 1, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **12412**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 982 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12412.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 7783 \u00f7 5 = 1556 remainder 3\n- **Step 2:** 1556 \u00f7 5 = 311 remainder 1\n- **Step 3:** 311 \u00f7 5 = 62 remainder 1\n- **Step 4:** 62 \u00f7 5 = 12 remainder 2\n- **Step 5:** 12 \u00f7 5 = 2 remainder 2\n- **Step 6:** 2 \u00f7 5 = 0 remainder 2\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders from bottom to top are: 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 7783 is **221113**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 221113.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **4984 \u00f7 5 = 996** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **996 \u00f7 5 = 199** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **199 \u00f7 5 = 39** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **39 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation:\n\n**4984 in base 5 is 124414.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 124414.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **9199 \u00f7 5 = 1839** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **1839 \u00f7 5 = 367** with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **367 \u00f7 5 = 73** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **73 \u00f7 5 = 14** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **14 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **4**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**Base 5 representation of 9199 is 243244.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 243244.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **220 \u00f7 5 = 44** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **44 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 3, 4, and 0.\n\nSo, reading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**220 in base 5 = 1340.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1340.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9037 \u00f7 5 = 1807** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1807 \u00f7 5 = 361** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **361 \u00f7 5 = 72** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **72 \u00f7 5 = 14** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **14 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **4**.\n- **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **242122**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 9037 is **242122**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 242122.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **8554 \u00f7 5 = 1710** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **1710 \u00f7 5 = 342** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **342 \u00f7 5 = 68** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **68 \u00f7 5 = 13** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **13 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 3, 3, 2, 0, 4.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**8554 in base 5 is 233204.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 233204.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **7431 \u00f7 5 = 1486** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1486 \u00f7 5 = 297** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **297 \u00f7 5 = 59** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **59 \u00f7 5 = 11** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **11 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation:\n\n**214211**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 214211.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **6866 \u00f7 5 = 1373** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1373 \u00f7 5 = 274** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **274 \u00f7 5 = 54** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **54 \u00f7 5 = 10** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **10 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **2, 0, 4, 4, 3, 1**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 6866 is **204431**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 204431.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **8955 \u00f7 5 = 1791** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **1791 \u00f7 5 = 358** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **358 \u00f7 5 = 71** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **71 \u00f7 5 = 14** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **14 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **4**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 0.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us: **241310**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 8955 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 241310.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division**: \n   - 604 \u00f7 5 = 120 with a remainder of 4.\n   \n2. **Second Division**: \n   - 120 \u00f7 5 = 24 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n3. **Third Division**: \n   - 24 \u00f7 5 = 4 with a remainder of 4.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division**: \n   - 4 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 4.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n- The remainders are 4, 4, 0, and 4.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **4404**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 604 is **4404**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 4404.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division**: \n   - 897 \u00f7 5 = 179 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n2. **Second Division**: \n   - 179 \u00f7 5 = 35 with a remainder of 4.\n   \n3. **Third Division**: \n   - 35 \u00f7 5 = 7 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division**: \n   - 7 \u00f7 5 = 1 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n5. **Fifth Division**: \n   - 1 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 0, 4, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us: **12042**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 897 is **12042**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12042.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **273 \u00f7 5** = 54 with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **54 \u00f7 5** = 10 with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **10 \u00f7 5** = 2 with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **2 \u00f7 5** = 0 with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 4, 3.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **2043**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 273 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2043.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **528 \u00f7 5 = 105** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **105 \u00f7 5 = 21** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **21 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4 (from the last division), 1, 0, and 3 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation:\n\n**4103**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 4103.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **4109 \u00f7 5 = 821** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **821 \u00f7 5 = 164** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **164 \u00f7 5 = 32** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **32 \u00f7 5 = 6** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **6 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 4109 is **112414**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 112414.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **228 \u00f7 5 = 45** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **45 \u00f7 5 = 9** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **9 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 4, 0, and 3.\n\nSo, reading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**228 in base 5 is 1403.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1403.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9395 \u00f7 5 = 1879** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1879 \u00f7 5 = 375** with a remainder of **4**.\n- **375 \u00f7 5 = 75** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **75 \u00f7 5 = 15** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **15 \u00f7 5 = 3** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **3 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0**.\n\nReading these from last to first gives us **300040**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 9395 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 300040.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **934 \u00f7 5 = 186** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **186 \u00f7 5 = 37** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **37 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 2, 2, 1, 4**.\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 5 representation of 934 is **12214**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12214.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **997 \u00f7 5 = 199** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **199 \u00f7 5 = 39** with a remainder of **4**.\n3. **39 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 4, 4, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **12442**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 997 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12442.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2867 \u00f7 5 = 573** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **573 \u00f7 5 = 114** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **114 \u00f7 5 = 22** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **22 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **4, 2, 4, 3, 2**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 2867 is **42432**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 42432.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division**: \n   - 57 \u00f7 5 = 11 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n2. **Second Division**: \n   - 11 \u00f7 5 = 2 with a remainder of 1.\n   \n3. **Third Division**: \n   - 2 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n- The remainders are 2 (from the third division), 1 (from the second division), and 2 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation of 57 as **212**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 212.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **576 \u00f7 5 = 115** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **115 \u00f7 5 = 23** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **23 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4, 3, 0, 1.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **4301**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 576 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 4301.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1694 \u00f7 5** = 338 remainder **4**\n2. **338 \u00f7 5** = 67 remainder **3**\n3. **67 \u00f7 5** = 13 remainder **2**\n4. **13 \u00f7 5** = 2 remainder **3**\n5. **2 \u00f7 5** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **2, 3, 2, 3, 4**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 1694 is **23234**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 23234.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division**: \n   - 889 \u00f7 5 = 177 with a remainder of 4.\n   \n2. **Second Division**: \n   - 177 \u00f7 5 = 35 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n3. **Third Division**: \n   - 35 \u00f7 5 = 7 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division**: \n   - 7 \u00f7 5 = 1 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n5. **Fifth Division**: \n   - 1 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the fifth division: 1\n- From the fourth division: 2\n- From the third division: 0\n- From the second division: 2\n- From the first division: 4\n\nPutting it all together, we read the remainders from bottom to top: **12024**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 889 is **12024**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12024.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7617 \u00f7 5 = 1523** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1523 \u00f7 5 = 304** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **304 \u00f7 5 = 60** with a remainder of **4**.\n- **60 \u00f7 5 = 12** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **12 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 0, 4, 3, 2.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us: **220432**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 7617 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 220432.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2752 \u00f7 5 = 550** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **550 \u00f7 5 = 110** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **110 \u00f7 5 = 22** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **22 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4, 2, 0, 0, 2.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **42002**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 2752 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 42002.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **7126 \u00f7 5 = 1425** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1425 \u00f7 5 = 285** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **285 \u00f7 5 = 57** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **57 \u00f7 5 = 11** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **11 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **210201**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 7126 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 210201.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **First Division**: \n  - 26 \u00f7 5 = 5 (Quotient)\n  - Remainder = 1 (because 26 - 5*5 = 1)\n\n- **Second Division**: \n  - 5 \u00f7 5 = 1 (Quotient)\n  - Remainder = 0 (because 5 - 5*1 = 0)\n\n- **Third Division**: \n  - 1 \u00f7 5 = 0 (Quotient)\n  - Remainder = 1 (because 1 - 5*0 = 1)\n\nNow we have the remainders from the divisions:\n- From the last division: 1\n- From the second division: 0\n- From the first division: 1\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **101**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 26 is **101**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 101.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **9269 \u00f7 5 = 1853** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **1853 \u00f7 5 = 370** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **370 \u00f7 5 = 74** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **74 \u00f7 5 = 14** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **14 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **4**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 4, 4, 0, 3, 4.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **240434**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 9269 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 240434.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **3438 \u00f7 5 = 687** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **687 \u00f7 5 = 137** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **137 \u00f7 5 = 27** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **27 \u00f7 5 = 5** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **5 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: **1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 3438 is **102223**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 102223.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **663 \u00f7 5 = 132** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **132 \u00f7 5 = 26** with a remainder of **2**.\n3. **26 \u00f7 5 = 5** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **5 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation of 663 as **10123**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 10123.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1352 \u00f7 5 = 270** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **270 \u00f7 5 = 54** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **54 \u00f7 5 = 10** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **10 \u00f7 5 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2 (from the last division), 0, 4, 0, 2.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **20402**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 1352 is **20402**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20402.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **5481 \u00f7 5 = 1096** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1096 \u00f7 5 = 219** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **219 \u00f7 5 = 43** with a remainder of **4**.\n4. **43 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1**.\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 5 representation of 5481 is **133411**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 133411.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **3516 \u00f7 5 = 703** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **703 \u00f7 5 = 140** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **140 \u00f7 5 = 28** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **28 \u00f7 5 = 5** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **5 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**103031** in base 5.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 103031.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **First Division**: \n  - 616 \u00f7 5 = 123 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Second Division**: \n  - 123 \u00f7 5 = 24 with a remainder of 3.\n  \n- **Third Division**: \n  - 24 \u00f7 5 = 4 with a remainder of 4.\n  \n- **Fourth Division**: \n  - 4 \u00f7 5 = 0 with a remainder of 4.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4 (from the fourth division), 4 (from the third division), 3 (from the second division), and 1 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n- Base 5 representation of 616 is **4431**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 4431.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **5466 \u00f7 5 = 1093** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1093 \u00f7 5 = 218** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **218 \u00f7 5 = 43** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **43 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **133331**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 5466 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 133331.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2752 \u00f7 5 = 550** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **550 \u00f7 5 = 110** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **110 \u00f7 5 = 22** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **22 \u00f7 5 = 4** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **4 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **4**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 4, 2, 0, 0, 2.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **42002**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 2752 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 42002.",

The base 5 number is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **205 \u00f7 5 = 41** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **41 \u00f7 5 = 8** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **8 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 3, 1, and 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**205 in base 5 = 1300.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1300.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **9409 \u00f7 5 = 1881** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **1881 \u00f7 5 = 376** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **376 \u00f7 5 = 75** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **75 \u00f7 5 = 15** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **15 \u00f7 5 = 3** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **3 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 5 representation:\n\n**9409 in base 5 is 300114.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 300114.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1134 \u00f7 5 = 226** with a remainder of **4**.\n2. **226 \u00f7 5 = 45** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **45 \u00f7 5 = 9** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **9 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **4**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 4, 0, 1, 4**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 1134 is **14014**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 14014.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **805 \u00f7 5 = 161** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **161 \u00f7 5 = 32** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **32 \u00f7 5 = 6** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **6 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 2, 1, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **11210**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 805 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11210.",

The base 5 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **934 \u00f7 5 = 186** with a remainder of **4**.\n- **186 \u00f7 5 = 37** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **37 \u00f7 5 = 7** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **7 \u00f7 5 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1 \u00f7 5 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 2, 2, 1, 4**.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **12214**.\n\nThus, the base 5 representation of 934 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12214.",
