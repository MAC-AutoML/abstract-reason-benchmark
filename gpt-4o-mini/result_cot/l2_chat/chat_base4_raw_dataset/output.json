The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1477 \u00f7 4** = 369 remainder **1**\n- **369 \u00f7 4** = 92 remainder **1**\n- **92 \u00f7 4** = 23 remainder **0**\n- **23 \u00f7 4** = 5 remainder **3**\n- **5 \u00f7 4** = 1 remainder **1**\n- **1 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **110311**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 1477 is **110311**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 110311.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1367 \u00f7 4** = 341 remainder **3**\n2. **341 \u00f7 4** = 85 remainder **1**\n3. **85 \u00f7 4** = 21 remainder **1**\n4. **21 \u00f7 4** = 5 remainder **1**\n5. **5 \u00f7 4** = 1 remainder **1**\n6. **1 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **111113**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 1367 is **111113**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 111113.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 2108 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 527\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 527 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 131\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 131 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 32\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 32 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 8\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 8 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 2\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 6:** Divide 2 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 2\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 2108 is **200330**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 200330.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1072 \u00f7 4 = 268** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **268 \u00f7 4 = 67** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **67 \u00f7 4 = 16** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **16 \u00f7 4 = 4** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **4 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **100300**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 1072 is **100300**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 100300.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **6950 \u00f7 4 = 1737** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1737 \u00f7 4 = 434** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **434 \u00f7 4 = 108** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **108 \u00f7 4 = 27** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **27 \u00f7 4 = 6** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **6 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: **1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 2**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 6950 is **1230212**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1230212.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **734 \u00f7 4** = 183 with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **183 \u00f7 4** = 45 with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **45 \u00f7 4** = 11 with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **11 \u00f7 4** = 2 with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 4** = 0 with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 3, 1, 3, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **23132**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 734 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 23132.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 168 by 4.\n  - 168 \u00f7 4 = 42 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide 42 by 4.\n  - 42 \u00f7 4 = 10 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide 10 by 4.\n  - 10 \u00f7 4 = 2 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 4:** Divide 2 by 4.\n  - 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow we have the remainders from the divisions:\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: 2, 2, 2, 0.\n\nSo, reading from bottom to top, the base 4 representation of 168 is **2200**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2200.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **431 \u00f7 4** = 107 remainder **3**\n2. **107 \u00f7 4** = 26 remainder **3**\n3. **26 \u00f7 4** = 6 remainder **2**\n4. **6 \u00f7 4** = 1 remainder **2**\n5. **1 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **12233**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 431 is **12233**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12233.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 981 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 245\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 245 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 61\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 61 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 15\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 15 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 3\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 3\n\nNow we have the remainders from the divisions: 3, 3, 1, 1, 1.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 4 representation:\n\n- Remainders: 3 (from 3), 3 (from 15), 1 (from 61), 1 (from 245), 1 (from 981)\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 981 is **33111**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 33111.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **2843 \u00f7 4** = 710 remainder **3**\n- **710 \u00f7 4** = 177 remainder **2**\n- **177 \u00f7 4** = 44 remainder **1**\n- **44 \u00f7 4** = 11 remainder **0**\n- **11 \u00f7 4** = 2 remainder **3**\n- **2 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **230213**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 2843 is **230213**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 230213.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **5094 \u00f7 4 = 1273** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1273 \u00f7 4 = 318** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **318 \u00f7 4 = 79** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **79 \u00f7 4 = 19** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **19 \u00f7 4 = 4** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **4 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2**.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us: **1033212**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 5094 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1033212.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **537 \u00f7 4** = 134 remainder **1**\n2. **134 \u00f7 4** = 33 remainder **2**\n3. **33 \u00f7 4** = 8 remainder **1**\n4. **8 \u00f7 4** = 2 remainder **0**\n5. **2 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **2, 0, 1, 2, 1**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 537 is **20121**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20121.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 8583 \u00f7 4 = 2145 remainder 3\n- **Step 2:** 2145 \u00f7 4 = 536 remainder 1\n- **Step 3:** 536 \u00f7 4 = 134 remainder 0\n- **Step 4:** 134 \u00f7 4 = 33 remainder 2\n- **Step 5:** 33 \u00f7 4 = 8 remainder 1\n- **Step 6:** 8 \u00f7 4 = 2 remainder 0\n- **Step 7:** 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 remainder 2\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top: 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 8583 is **2012033**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2012033.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **356 \u00f7 4 = 89** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **89 \u00f7 4 = 22** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **22 \u00f7 4 = 5** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **5 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from 1), 1 (from 5), 2 (from 22), 1 (from 89), and 0 (from 356).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **11210**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 356 is **11210**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11210.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **965 \u00f7 4** = 241 remainder **1**\n- **241 \u00f7 4** = 60 remainder **1**\n- **60 \u00f7 4** = 15 remainder **0**\n- **15 \u00f7 4** = 3 remainder **3**\n- **3 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **3**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **33011**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 965 is **33011**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 33011.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2843 \u00f7 4** = 710 remainder **3**\n2. **710 \u00f7 4** = 177 remainder **2**\n3. **177 \u00f7 4** = 44 remainder **1**\n4. **44 \u00f7 4** = 11 remainder **0**\n5. **11 \u00f7 4** = 2 remainder **3**\n6. **2 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **2**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **230123**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 2843 is **230123**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 230123.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1144 \u00f7 4 = 286** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **286 \u00f7 4 = 71** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **71 \u00f7 4 = 17** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **17 \u00f7 4 = 4** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **4 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 0**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **103220**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 1144 is **103220**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 103220.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **First Division**: \n  - 76 \u00f7 4 = 19 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Second Division**: \n  - 19 \u00f7 4 = 4 with a remainder of 3.\n  \n- **Third Division**: \n  - 4 \u00f7 4 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Fourth Division**: \n  - 1 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 0, 3, 0 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **1300**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 76 is **1300**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1300.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **8997 \u00f7 4 = 2249** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2249 \u00f7 4 = 562** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **562 \u00f7 4 = 140** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **140 \u00f7 4 = 35** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **35 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: **2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 8997 is **2030211**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2030211.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **892 \u00f7 4 = 223** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **223 \u00f7 4 = 55** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **55 \u00f7 4 = 13** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **13 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **3, 1, 3, 3, 0**.\n\nReading them from bottom to top gives us **31330**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 892 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 31330.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   - 526 \u00f7 4 = 131 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n2. **Second Division:**\n   - 131 \u00f7 4 = 32 with a remainder of 3.\n   \n3. **Third Division:**\n   - 32 \u00f7 4 = 8 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   - 8 \u00f7 4 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n5. **Fifth Division:**\n   - 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 0, 3, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **20032**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 526 is **20032**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20032.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **5026 \u00f7 4 = 1256** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **1256 \u00f7 4 = 314** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **314 \u00f7 4 = 78** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **78 \u00f7 4 = 19** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **19 \u00f7 4 = 4** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **4 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n7. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 0, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **1032202**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 5026 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1032202.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **931 \u00f7 4** = 232 remainder **3**\n- **232 \u00f7 4** = 58 remainder **0**\n- **58 \u00f7 4** = 14 remainder **2**\n- **14 \u00f7 4** = 3 remainder **2**\n- **3 \u00f7 4** = 0 remainder **3**\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **32203**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 931 is **32203**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 32203.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1**: 6431 \u00f7 4 = 1607 remainder 3\n- **Step 2**: 1607 \u00f7 4 = 401 remainder 3\n- **Step 3**: 401 \u00f7 4 = 100 remainder 1\n- **Step 4**: 100 \u00f7 4 = 25 remainder 0\n- **Step 5**: 25 \u00f7 4 = 6 remainder 1\n- **Step 6**: 6 \u00f7 4 = 1 remainder 2\n- **Step 7**: 1 \u00f7 4 = 0 remainder 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- Reading from bottom to top, we get: 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 6431 is **1210333**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1210333.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **7875 \u00f7 4 = 1968** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **1968 \u00f7 4 = 492** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **492 \u00f7 4 = 123** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **123 \u00f7 4 = 30** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **30 \u00f7 4 = 7** with a remainder of **2**.\n6. **7 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n7. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 7875 is **1323003**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1323003.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7783 \u00f7 4 = 1945** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **1945 \u00f7 4 = 486** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **486 \u00f7 4 = 121** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **121 \u00f7 4 = 30** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **30 \u00f7 4 = 7** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **7 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **1321213**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 7783 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1321213.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9199 \u00f7 4 = 2299** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **2299 \u00f7 4 = 574** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **574 \u00f7 4 = 143** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **143 \u00f7 4 = 35** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **35 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3**.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**2033333**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 9199 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2033333.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 8583 \u00f7 4 = 2145 remainder 3\n- **Step 2:** 2145 \u00f7 4 = 536 remainder 1\n- **Step 3:** 536 \u00f7 4 = 134 remainder 0\n- **Step 4:** 134 \u00f7 4 = 33 remainder 2\n- **Step 5:** 33 \u00f7 4 = 8 remainder 1\n- **Step 6:** 8 \u00f7 4 = 2 remainder 0\n- **Step 7:** 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 remainder 2\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From Step 7: 2\n- From Step 6: 0\n- From Step 5: 1\n- From Step 4: 2\n- From Step 3: 0\n- From Step 2: 1\n- From Step 1: 3\n\nPutting it all together, we read the remainders from bottom to top:\n\nThus, 8583 in base 4 is **2012013**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2012013.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **220 \u00f7 4 = 55** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **55 \u00f7 4 = 13** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **13 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 1, 3, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **3130**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 220 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 3130.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9037 \u00f7 4 = 2259** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2259 \u00f7 4 = 564** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **564 \u00f7 4 = 141** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **141 \u00f7 4 = 35** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **35 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: **2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 9037 is **2031031**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2031031.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **6236 \u00f7 4 = 1559** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **1559 \u00f7 4 = 389** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **389 \u00f7 4 = 97** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **97 \u00f7 4 = 24** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **24 \u00f7 4 = 6** with a remainder of **0**.\n6. **6 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n7. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: **1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0**.\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 4 representation of 6236 is **1201130**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1201130.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **112 \u00f7 4 = 28** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **28 \u00f7 4 = 7** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **7 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 3, 0, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **1300**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 112 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1300.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **8554 \u00f7 4 = 2138** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2138 \u00f7 4 = 534** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **534 \u00f7 4 = 133** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **133 \u00f7 4 = 33** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **33 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **201122**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 8554 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 201122.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7431 \u00f7 4 = 1857** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **1857 \u00f7 4 = 464** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **464 \u00f7 4 = 116** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **116 \u00f7 4 = 29** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **29 \u00f7 4 = 7** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **7 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **1310013**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 7431 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1310013.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **6866 \u00f7 4 = 1716** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1716 \u00f7 4 = 429** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **429 \u00f7 4 = 107** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **107 \u00f7 4 = 26** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **26 \u00f7 4 = 6** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **6 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2**.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 4 representation:\n\nThus, **6866 in base 4 is 1223122**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1223122.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **8955 \u00f7 4 = 2238** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **2238 \u00f7 4 = 559** with a remainder of **2**.\n3. **559 \u00f7 4 = 139** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **139 \u00f7 4 = 34** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **34 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **2**.\n6. **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n7. **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **2033323**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 8955 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2033323.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **528 \u00f7 4 = 132** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **132 \u00f7 4 = 33** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **33 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 1, 0, 0.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **20100**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 528 is **20100**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20100.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 604 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 151\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 151 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 37\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 37 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 9\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 9 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 2\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 2 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 2\n\nNow, we have the remainders: 0, 3, 1, 1, 2.

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **477 \u00f7 4 = 119** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **119 \u00f7 4 = 29** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **29 \u00f7 4 = 7** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **7 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 3, 1, 3, 1 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**Base 4 representation of 477 = 13131.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 13131.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 988 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 247\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 247 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 61\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 61 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 15\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 15 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 3\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 3\n\nNow, we have the remainders from the divisions: 0, 3, 1, 3, 3. \n\nReading these remainders from bottom to top gives us the base 4 representation:\n\n- Remainders in reverse order: 33130\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 988 is **33130**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 33130.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **273 \u00f7 4** = 68 with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **68 \u00f7 4** = 17 with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **17 \u00f7 4** = 4 with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **4 \u00f7 4** = 1 with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 4** = 0 with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1 (from 1), 0 (from 4), 1 (from 17), 0 (from 68), 1 (from 273).\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us: **10101**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 273 is **10101**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 10101.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **528 \u00f7 4 = 132** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **132 \u00f7 4 = 33** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **33 \u00f7 4 = 8** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **8 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 0, 1, 0, 0.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get **20100**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 528 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20100.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 212 by 4.\n  - 212 \u00f7 4 = 53 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide 53 by 4.\n  - 53 \u00f7 4 = 13 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide 13 by 4.\n  - 13 \u00f7 4 = 3 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Step 4:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - 3 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow we have the remainders: 3, 1, 1, 0.\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us the base 4 representation of 212.\n\nThus, 212 in base 4 is **3110**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 3110.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   - 330 \u00f7 4 = 82 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n2. **Second Division:**\n   - 82 \u00f7 4 = 20 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n3. **Third Division:**\n   - 20 \u00f7 4 = 5 with a remainder of 0.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   - 5 \u00f7 4 = 1 with a remainder of 1.\n   \n5. **Fifth Division:**\n   - 1 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 0, 2, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **11022**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 330 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11022.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **934 \u00f7 4 = 233** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **233 \u00f7 4 = 58** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **58 \u00f7 4 = 14** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **14 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **3, 2, 2, 1, 2**.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 4 representation of 934 as **32212**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 32212.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 548 by 4.\n  - 548 \u00f7 4 = 137 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide 137 by 4.\n  - 137 \u00f7 4 = 34 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide 34 by 4.\n  - 34 \u00f7 4 = 8 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 4:** Divide 8 by 4.\n  - 8 \u00f7 4 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 5:** Divide 2 by 4.\n  - 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2 (from the last division), 0, 2, 1, 0 (from the first division).\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **20210**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 548 is **20210**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20210.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 57 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 14\n  - Remainder: 1 (This is the least significant digit)\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 14 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 3\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 3 (This is the most significant digit)\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n- The remainders are 3, 2, and 1.\n\nThus, reading from bottom to top, the base 4 representation of 57 is **321**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 321.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 610 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 152\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 152 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 38\n  - Remainder: 0\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 38 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 9\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 9 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 2\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 2 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 2\n\nNow, we have the remainders from the divisions: 2, 0, 2, 1, 2. Reading these from bottom to top gives us the base 4 representation.\n\nThus, 610 in base 4 is **21022**.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 21022.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **First Division**: \n  - 576 \u00f7 4 = 144 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Second Division**: \n  - 144 \u00f7 4 = 36 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Third Division**: \n  - 36 \u00f7 4 = 9 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Fourth Division**: \n  - 9 \u00f7 4 = 2 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Fifth Division**: \n  - 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 1, 0, 0, 0.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **21000**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 576 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 21000.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **3650 \u00f7 4 = 912** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **912 \u00f7 4 = 228** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **228 \u00f7 4 = 57** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **57 \u00f7 4 = 14** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **14 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us **320002**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 3650 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 320002.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 889 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 222\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 222 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 55\n  - Remainder: 2\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 55 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 13\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 13 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 3\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 5:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 3\n\nNow we have the remainders from the divisions: 3, 1, 3, 2, 1.\n\nReading these from bottom to top gives us the base 4 representation of 889.\n\nThus, 889 in base 4 is **31321**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 31321.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 56 by 4.\n  - 56 \u00f7 4 = 14 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide 14 by 4.\n  - 14 \u00f7 4 = 3 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - 3 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow we have the remainders: 0, 2, and 3. Reading them in reverse order gives us:\n\n- Remainders in reverse: 320.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 56 is **320**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 320.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **7617 \u00f7 4 = 1904** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1904 \u00f7 4 = 476** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **476 \u00f7 4 = 119** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **119 \u00f7 4 = 29** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **29 \u00f7 4 = 7** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **7 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **1310031**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 7617 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1310031.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **2752 \u00f7 4 = 688** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **688 \u00f7 4 = 172** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **172 \u00f7 4 = 43** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **43 \u00f7 4 = 10** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **10 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n6. **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **220300**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 2752 is **220300**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 220300.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **7126 \u00f7 4 = 1781** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **1781 \u00f7 4 = 445** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **445 \u00f7 4 = 111** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **111 \u00f7 4 = 27** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **27 \u00f7 4 = 6** with a remainder of **3**.\n6. **6 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n7. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **1233112**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 7126 is **1233112**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1233112.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **435 \u00f7 4 = 108** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **108 \u00f7 4 = 27** with a remainder of **0**.\n3. **27 \u00f7 4 = 6** with a remainder of **3**.\n4. **6 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 3, 0, 3.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **12303**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 435 is **12303**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 12303.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **3438 \u00f7 4 = 859** with a remainder of **2**.\n2. **859 \u00f7 4 = 214** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **214 \u00f7 4 = 53** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **53 \u00f7 4 = 13** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **13 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **1**.\n6. **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **312132**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 3438 is **312132**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 312132.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **663 \u00f7 4 = 165** with a remainder of **3**.\n2. **165 \u00f7 4 = 41** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **41 \u00f7 4 = 10** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **10 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n5. **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 2, 2, 1, 1, 3.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **22113**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 663 is **22113**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 22113.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **1352 \u00f7 4 = 338** with a remainder of **0**.\n2. **338 \u00f7 4 = 84** with a remainder of **2**.\n3. **84 \u00f7 4 = 21** with a remainder of **0**.\n4. **21 \u00f7 4 = 5** with a remainder of **1**.\n5. **5 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n6. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **111020**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 1352 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 111020.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 119 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 29\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 2:** Divide 29 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 7\n  - Remainder: 1\n\n- **Step 3:** Divide 7 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 1\n  - Remainder: 3\n\n- **Step 4:** Divide 1 by 4.\n  - Quotient: 0\n  - Remainder: 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n- The remainders are: 1 (from the last division), 3, 1, and 3.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **1313**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 119 is **1313**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1313.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** 5481 \u00f7 4 = 1370 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 2:** 1370 \u00f7 4 = 342 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 3:** 342 \u00f7 4 = 85 with a remainder of 2\n- **Step 4:** 85 \u00f7 4 = 21 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 5:** 21 \u00f7 4 = 5 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 6:** 5 \u00f7 4 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n- **Step 7:** 1 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- From bottom to top, the remainders are: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 5481 is **1112211**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1112211.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **Divide 452 by 4**:\n   - Quotient: 113\n   - Remainder: 0\n\n2. **Divide 113 by 4**:\n   - Quotient: 28\n   - Remainder: 1\n\n3. **Divide 28 by 4**:\n   - Quotient: 7\n   - Remainder: 0\n\n4. **Divide 7 by 4**:\n   - Quotient: 1\n   - Remainder: 3\n\n5. **Divide 1 by 4**:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 1\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n- The remainders are: 1, 3, 0, 1, 0\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **13010**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 452 is **13010**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 13010.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   - 474 \u00f7 4 = 118 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n2. **Second Division:**\n   - 118 \u00f7 4 = 29 with a remainder of 2.\n   \n3. **Third Division:**\n   - 29 \u00f7 4 = 7 with a remainder of 1.\n   \n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   - 7 \u00f7 4 = 1 with a remainder of 3.\n   \n5. **Fifth Division:**\n   - 1 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 3, 1, 2, 2.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **13122**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 474 is **13122**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 13122.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 616 by 4.\n  - 616 \u00f7 4 = 154 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide 154 by 4.\n  - 154 \u00f7 4 = 38 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide 38 by 4.\n  - 38 \u00f7 4 = 9 with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- **Step 4:** Divide 9 by 4.\n  - 9 \u00f7 4 = 2 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Step 5:** Divide 2 by 4.\n  - 2 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we have the remainders from the divisions:\n- From the last division to the first, the remainders are: 2, 1, 2, 2, 0.\n\nReading these in reverse order gives us: **21220**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 616 is **21220**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 21220.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **5466 \u00f7 4 = 1366** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **1366 \u00f7 4 = 341** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **341 \u00f7 4 = 85** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **85 \u00f7 4 = 21** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **21 \u00f7 4 = 5** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **5 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2**.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get:\n\n**1111122** in base 4.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 5466 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1111122.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **2752 \u00f7 4 = 688** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **688 \u00f7 4 = 172** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **172 \u00f7 4 = 43** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **43 \u00f7 4 = 10** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **10 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0**.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 4 representation:\n\n**2752 in base 4 is 223000.**\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 223000.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **Step 1:** Divide 205 by 4.\n  - 205 \u00f7 4 = 51 with a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Divide 51 by 4.\n  - 51 \u00f7 4 = 12 with a remainder of 3.\n  \n- **Step 3:** Divide 12 by 4.\n  - 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n  \n- **Step 4:** Divide 3 by 4.\n  - 3 \u00f7 4 = 0 with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow we have the remainders: 3 (from the last division), 0, 3, and 1 (from the first division).\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us: **3031**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 205 is **3031**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 3031.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **9409 \u00f7 4 = 2352** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2352 \u00f7 4 = 588** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **588 \u00f7 4 = 147** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **147 \u00f7 4 = 36** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **36 \u00f7 4 = 9** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **9 \u00f7 4 = 2** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **2 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **2**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **2103001**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 9409 is **2103001**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2103001.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **1134 \u00f7 4 = 283** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **283 \u00f7 4 = 70** with a remainder of **3**.\n- **70 \u00f7 4 = 17** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **17 \u00f7 4 = 4** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **4 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **0**.\n- **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: **1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2**.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **102312**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 1134 is **102312**.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 102312.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **805 \u00f7 4 = 201** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **201 \u00f7 4 = 50** with a remainder of **1**.\n3. **50 \u00f7 4 = 12** with a remainder of **2**.\n4. **12 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **0**.\n5. **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 1.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **30211**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 805 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 30211.",

The base 4 representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n1. **6877 \u00f7 4 = 1719** with a remainder of **1**.\n2. **1719 \u00f7 4 = 429** with a remainder of **3**.\n3. **429 \u00f7 4 = 107** with a remainder of **1**.\n4. **107 \u00f7 4 = 26** with a remainder of **3**.\n5. **26 \u00f7 4 = 6** with a remainder of **2**.\n6. **6 \u00f7 4 = 1** with a remainder of **2**.\n7. **1 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **1**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1.\n\nReading them in reverse order gives us: **1223131**.\n\nThus, the base 4 representation of 6877 is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1223131.",

The base 4 representation is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform the conversion:\n\n- **934 \u00f7 4 = 233** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **233 \u00f7 4 = 58** with a remainder of **1**.\n- **58 \u00f7 4 = 14** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **14 \u00f7 4 = 3** with a remainder of **2**.\n- **3 \u00f7 4 = 0** with a remainder of **3**.\n\nNow, we collect the remainders from the last division to the first:\n\n- The remainders are: 3, 2, 2, 1, 2.\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get the base 4 representation of 934 as **32212**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 32212.",
