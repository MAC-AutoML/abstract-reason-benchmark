However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Starting from the rightmost column:\n     - \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) in base 10. In base 4, \\(5\\) is \\(1\\) with a carry of \\(1\\) (since \\(5 = 4 + 1\\)).\n   - Next column (including carry):\n     - \\(0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 2\\) in base 4. Write down \\(2\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) in base 10. In base 4, \\(4\\) is \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n   - Next column (including carry):\n     - \\(1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 2\\) in base 4. Write down \\(2\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(0 + 0 = 0\\). Write down \\(0\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(2 + 0 = 2\\). Write down \\(2\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 0 = 3\\). Write down \\(3\\).\n   - The leftmost column remains \\(3\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we combine the results from each column, starting from the leftmost to the rightmost.\n\nSo, the result of \\(32001302 + 113\\) in base 4 is:\n\n```\n   32001302\n+      113\n-----------\n   32020212\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 32020212.",

In base 4, \\(6\\) is \\(1\\) with a carry of \\(1\\) (since \\(6 = 4 + 2\\)).\n   - **Third column**: \\(0 + 2 + 1 \\text{ (carry)} = 3\\)\n   - **Fourth column**: \\(0 + 0 = 0\\)\n   - **Fifth column**: \\(0 + 3 = 3\\)\n   - **Sixth column**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). In base 4, \\(4\\) is \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n   - **Seventh column**: \\(1 + 0 + 1 \\text{ (carry)} = 2\\)\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the rightmost column to the leftmost, we have: \\(2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\n\n```\n  1000031\n+  332030\n-----------\n  2030311\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2030311.",

In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 with a carry of 1 (since 4 = 4 + 0).\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 0 + 0 = 1. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 2 = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 0 + 1 = 2. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 0 = 3. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 0 = 3. No carry.\n\n3. **Write down the results from each column**:\n   - From the rightmost column: 1\n   - From the next column: 0\n   - From the next column: 1\n   - From the next column: 1\n   - From the next column: 2\n   - From the next column: 3\n   - From the leftmost column: 3\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```\nResult: 33120101\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 33120101.",

In base 4, \\(5\\) is represented as \\(1\\) with a carry of \\(1\\) (since \\(5 = 4 + 1\\)).\n   - **Next column**: \\(2 + 0 + 1 \\text{ (carry)} = 3\\). This is less than \\(4\\), so we write down \\(3\\) with no carry.\n   - **Next column**: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\). Again, this is less than \\(4\\), so we write down \\(1\\) with no carry.\n   - **Leftmost column**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\). In base 4, this is \\(1\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Final carry**: Since we have a carry of \\(1\\) left, we write it down as the leftmost digit.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n- From the rightmost column: \\(1\\)\n- From the second column: \\(3\\)\n- From the third column: \\(1\\)\n- From the leftmost column: \\(1\\) (from the carry)\n\nThus, the result of \\(2123 + 3002\\) in base 4 is \\(13111\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 13111.",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column**: Start from the rightmost column and move left, carrying over as necessary.\n\n   - **Rightmost column**: \\( 0 + 3 = 3 \\) (no carry)\n   - **Next column**: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) (no carry)\n   - **Next column**: \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\). In base 4, \\( 6 \\) is represented as \\( 1 \\) with a carry of \\( 2 \\) (since \\( 6 = 4 + 2 \\)).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 1 + 2 + 1 \\) (from the carry) = \\( 4 \\). In base 4, \\( 4 \\) is represented as \\( 0 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\).\n   - **Leftmost column**: \\( 1 + 0 + 1 \\) (from the carry) = \\( 2 \\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column, taking into account the carries:\n\n```\n   1 (carry)\n   11310\n+    313\n---------\n   20103\n```\n\nThus, the final result of \\( 313 + 11310 \\) in base 4 is \\( 20103 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20103.",

In base 4, \\( 5 \\) is represented as \\( 1 \\) (carry) and \\( 1 \\) (the remainder). So we write down \\( 1 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\).\n\n- **Next column**: \\( 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 3 \\). We write down \\( 3 \\).\n\n- **Next column**: \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\). Again, in base 4, \\( 5 \\) is \\( 1 \\) (carry) and \\( 1 \\) (the remainder). So we write down \\( 1 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\).\n\n- **Next column**: \\( 1 + 1 (carry) = 2 \\). We write down \\( 2 \\).\n\n- **Next column**: \\( 1 \\) (there's nothing to add) remains \\( 1 \\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Now we combine the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n```\n   111312\n+   1213\n---------\n  121101\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 121101.",

In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3 (no carry)\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 1 = 2 (no carry)\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 1 = 1 (no carry)\n   - **Leftmost column**: 1 (from 1112022) = 1 (no carry)\n\n3. **Write down the results from each column**:\n   - From right to left, we have: 3 (from the first column), 1 (from the second column), 3 (from the third column), 2 (from the fourth column), 1 (from the fifth column), and 1 (from the sixth column).\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```\n   101231\n+ 1112022\n-----------\n  1203133\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1203133.",

In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 with a carry of 1 (write down 0 and carry over 1).\n     - 1 (carry) + 3 + 2 = 6. In base 4, 6 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (write down 1 and carry over 1).\n     - 1 (carry) + 3 + 2 = 6.

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) in base 4, which is \\(10\\) in base 4. Write down \\(0\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 5\\) in base 4, which is \\(11\\) in base 4. Write down \\(1\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5\\) in base 4, which is \\(11\\) in base 4. Write down \\(1\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 4\\) in base 4, which is \\(10\\) in base 4. Write down \\(0\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5\\) in base 4, which is \\(11\\) in base 4. Write down \\(1\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - Last column:\n     - \\(2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3\\) in base 4. Write down \\(3\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now, we combine all the digits we wrote down from the addition:\n```\n   223233\n+   3211\n---------\n   310110\n```\n\nThus, the final result of \\(223233 + 3211\\) in base 4 is \\(310110\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is 310110.",

In base 4, \\(4\\) is represented as \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 4\\). Again, this is \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n- **Next column**: \\(0 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 4\\). This is also \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n- **Next column**: \\(0 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 3\\). This is \\(3\\) with no carry.\n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 0 = 3\\). This is \\(3\\) with no carry.\n- **Next column**: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\). This is \\(1\\) with no carry.\n- **Next column**: \\(2 + 0 = 2\\). This is \\(2\\) with no carry.\n- **Leftmost column**: \\(1 + 0 = 1\\). This is \\(1\\) with no carry.\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```\n   12130031\n+     23303\n-----------\n   12133000\n```\n\nThus, the final result of \\(12130031 + 23303\\) in base 4 is:\n\n**Answer: The answer is 12133000.**",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - \\(0 + 1 = 1\\) (base 4)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(2 + 0 = 2\\) (base 4)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) (base 4). In base 4, \\(6\\) is represented as \\(1\\) carry \\(2\\) (since \\(6 = 4 + 2\\)).\n   - Next column (including carry):\n     - \\(1 + 1 + 0 = 2\\) (base 4)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 0 = 3\\) (base 4)\n\n4. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the leftmost column to the rightmost, we have:\n     - \\(3\\) (from the leftmost column)\n     - \\(2\\) (next column)\n     - \\(1\\) (next column, from carry)\n     - \\(2\\) (next column)\n     - \\(1\\) (rightmost column)\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\n\n```\n   311320\n+    2301\n---------\n   320221\n```\n\nThus, the final answer in base 4 is:\n\n**Answer: The answer is 320221.**",

In base 4, \\(4\\) is represented as \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n  \n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 7\\). In base 4, \\(7\\) is represented as \\(3\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n\n- **Next column**: \\(2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5\\). In base 4, \\(5\\) is represented as \\(1\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n\n- **Next column**: \\(0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 2\\). No carry here.\n\n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 0 = 3\\). No carry here.\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost column.\n\nSo, we have:\n- From the leftmost column: \\(3\\)\n- Next column: \\(2\\)\n- Next column: \\(1\\)\n- Next column: \\(3\\)\n- Next column: \\(0\\)\n\nPutting it all together, we get \\(32130\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 32130.",

However, we will perform the addition directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(0 + 3 = 3\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 0 = 3\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(0 + 1 = 1\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(1\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(2 + 0 = 2\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(2\\))\n   - Finally, the leftmost column:\n     - \\(2 + 0 = 2\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(2\\))\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column:\n\n```\n   2310301\n+     2032\n-----------\n   2323303\n```\n\nThus, the result of \\(2032 + 2310301\\) in base 4 is \\(2323303\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is 2323303.",

However, we will perform the addition directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column**: Starting from the rightmost column, we will add the digits and carry over if the sum exceeds 3 (since we are in base 4).\n\n- **Rightmost column**: \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\). In base 4, \\( 5 \\) is \\( 1 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\) (since \\( 5 = 4 + 1 \\)).\n- **Next column**: \\( 1 + 2 + 1 \\) (carry) = \\( 4 \\). In base 4, \\( 4 \\) is \\( 0 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\).\n- **Next column**: \\( 1 + 1 + 1 \\) (carry) = \\( 3 \\). No carry.\n- **Next column**: \\( 2 + 0 = 2 \\). No carry.\n- **Next column**: \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\). No carry.\n- **Leftmost column**: \\( 1 \\) (from \\( 1012112 \\)). No carry.\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n- Leftmost: \\( 1 \\)\n- Next: \\( 1 \\)\n- Next: \\( 2 \\)\n- Next: \\( 3 \\)\n- Next: \\( 0 \\)\n- Rightmost: \\( 1 \\)\n\nThus, the result of \\( 13323 + 1012112 \\) in base 4 is \\( 1123011 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1123011.",

In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 1 (write down).\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 7. In base 4, 7 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 3 (write down).\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 2. Write down 2.\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 1 = 2. Write down 2.\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 3 = 6. In base 4, 6 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 2 (write down).\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 2. Write down 2.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the leftmost column to the rightmost, we have: 2 (from the last column), 2, 2, 3, 1, 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\n\n```\nResult: 2212311\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2212311.",

In base 4, \\( 4 \\) is represented as \\( 10 \\) (which means we write down \\( 0 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\)).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 3 + 2 + 1 \\) (the carry) = \\( 6 \\). In base 4, \\( 6 \\) is represented as \\( 12 \\) (write down \\( 2 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\)).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 1 + 3 + 1 \\) (the carry) = \\( 5 \\). In base 4, \\( 5 \\) is represented as \\( 11 \\) (write down \\( 1 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\)).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 1 + 0 + 1 \\) (the carry) = \\( 2 \\). Write down \\( 2 \\).\n   - **Leftmost column**: \\( 3 + 0 = 3 \\). Write down \\( 3 \\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the calculations, we have:\n     - Leftmost: \\( 3 \\)\n     - Next: \\( 2 \\)\n     - Next: \\( 1 \\)\n     - Next: \\( 2 \\)\n     - Rightmost: \\( 0 \\)\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get \\( 32120 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 32120.",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column**: Starting from the rightmost column, we will add the digits and carry over if the sum exceeds 3 (since we are in base 4).\n\n   - **Rightmost column**: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\). In base 4, \\(4\\) is represented as \\(10\\), so we write down \\(0\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 3\\). We write down \\(3\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\). In base 4, \\(5\\) is represented as \\(11\\), so we write down \\(1\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 2\\). We write down \\(2\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(2 + 0 = 2\\). We write down \\(2\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we combine the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost.\n\nSo, the result of the addition is:\n\n```\n   20213\n+  1311\n--------\n  22030\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 22030.",

In base 4, \\(4\\) is represented as \\(10\\), so we write down \\(0\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - **Leftmost column**: \\(2 + 2 + 1 \\text{ (carry)} = 5\\) (base 4). In base 4, \\(5\\) is represented as \\(11\\), so we write down \\(1\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n\n3. **Final carry**: Since we have a carry of \\(1\\) left, we write it down as the next leftmost digit.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n```\n   2111\n + 2300\n --------\n  11011\n```\n\nThus, the result of \\(2111 + 2300\\) in base 4 is \\(11011\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is 11011.",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - \\( 2 + 0 = 2 \\) (in base 4, this is still 2)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\) (in base 4, this is 10, so we write down 0 and carry over 1)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\( 0 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 3 \\) (in base 4, this is still 3)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\) (in base 4, this is still 1)\n   - Last column:\n     - \\( 3 + 0 = 3 \\) (in base 4, this is still 3)\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost column:\n\n```\n   3  1  3  0  2\n```\n\nThus, the result of \\( 11012 + 302330 \\) in base 4 is \\( 31302 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 31302.",

In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5. Again, this is 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 5. This is also 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 5. This is again 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1. No carry here.\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 3 = 4. In base 4, this is 0 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 2. No carry here.\n   - **Leftmost column**: 3 + 1 = 4. In base 4, this is 0 with a carry of 1.\n\n3. **Final carry**: Since we have a carry of 1 left after the last column, we need to add that to the leftmost position.\n\n4. **Putting it all together**:\n   - From the rightmost to the leftmost, we have: 1 (from the first column), 1 (from the second column), 1 (from the third column), 1 (from the fourth column), 0 (from the fifth column), 0 (from the sixth column), 2 (from the seventh column), and 1 (from the carry in the eighth column).\n\nSo, the final result is:\n```\n10011111\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 10011111.",

In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 - 4 = 1).\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 1 + 2 = 4. In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 3 + 1 = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 3 + 0 = 4. In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 3 + 1 = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 0 + 1 = 2. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 3 = 3. No carry.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the leftmost column to the rightmost, we have: 3 (from the last column), 2 (from the second last), 1 (from the third last), 0 (from the fourth last), 1 (from the fifth last), 1 (from the sixth last), and 1 (from the carry).\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n```\nResult: 3201011\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 3201011.",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column**: Starting from the rightmost column, we will add the digits together, carrying over if the sum exceeds 3 (since we are in base 4).\n\n- **Rightmost column**: \\(0 + 2 = 2\\) (write down 2)\n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 1 = 4\\) (which is \\(10\\) in base 4, write down 0 and carry over 1)\n- **Next column**: \\(0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\\) (write down 1)\n- **Next column**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\) (which is \\(10\\) in base 4, write down 0 and carry over 1)\n- **Next column**: \\(0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\\) (write down 1)\n- **Next column**: \\(2 + 0 = 2\\) (write down 2)\n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 0 = 3\\) (write down 3)\n- **Leftmost column**: \\(2 + 0 = 2\\) (write down 2)\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we combine all the digits we wrote down from the bottom to the top.\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n```\n   23001030\n+      3012\n-----------\n   23012002\n```\n\nThus, the final answer in base 4 is:\n\n**Answer: The answer is 23012002.**",

In base 4, \\( 6 \\) is \\( 1 \\) with a carry of \\( 2 \\) (since \\( 6 = 4 + 2 \\)).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 2 + 2 + 2 \\) (carry) = \\( 6 \\). Again, in base 4, this is \\( 1 \\) with a carry of \\( 2 \\).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 3 + 0 + 2 \\) (carry) = \\( 5 \\). In base 4, this is \\( 1 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 3 + 0 + 1 \\) (carry) = \\( 4 \\). In base 4, this is \\( 0 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\).\n   - **Next column**: \\( 3 + 2 + 1 \\) (carry) = \\( 6 \\). In base 4, this is \\( 1 \\) with a carry of \\( 2 \\).\n   - **Leftmost column**: \\( 0 + 2 + 2 \\) (carry) = \\( 4 \\). In base 4, this is \\( 0 \\) with a carry of \\( 1 \\).\n\n3. **Final carry**: Since we have a carry of \\( 1 \\) left, we add it to the leftmost column.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n- From the rightmost column: \\( 1 \\)\n- Next column: \\( 2 \\)\n- Next column: \\( 1 \\)\n- Next column: \\( 0 \\)\n- Next column: \\( 0 \\)\n- Next column: \\( 1 \\)\n- Leftmost column: \\( 1 \\)\n\nThus, the result of \\( 333230 + 2200231 \\) in base 4 is \\( 1001211 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is 1001211.",

In base 4, \\(6\\) is \\(1\\) with a carry of \\(2\\) (since \\(6 = 4 + 2\\)).\n  \n- **Next column**: \\(1 + 1 + 2 \\text{ (carry)} = 4\\). In base 4, \\(4\\) is \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\) (since \\(4 = 4 + 0\\)).\n  \n- **Next column**: \\(3 + 0 + 1 \\text{ (carry)} = 4\\). Again, in base 4, this is \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\).\n  \n- **Next column**: \\(1 + 1 + 1 \\text{ (carry)} = 3\\). This stays as \\(3\\) with no carry.\n  \n- **Next column**: \\(0 + 0 = 0\\). This stays as \\(0\\) with no carry.\n  \n- **Leftmost column**: \\(3 + 0 = 3\\). This stays as \\(3\\) with no carry.\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Now we can write down the results from each column, starting from the leftmost column to the rightmost column.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n- Leftmost: \\(3\\)\n- Next: \\(0\\)\n- Next: \\(3\\)\n- Next: \\(0\\)\n- Next: \\(0\\)\n- Rightmost: \\(1\\)\n\nSo, the final result is \\(303001\\) in base 4.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 303001.",

In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 1 (write down).\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 4. In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 (carry 1) and 1 (write down).\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 1 (write down).\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3. Write down 3 (no carry).\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 1 = 4. In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 (carry 1) and 1 (write down).\n   - **Leftmost column**: 1 + 1 (carry) = 2. Write down 2 (no carry).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the rightmost to the leftmost, we have: 2 (from the last column), 0, 1, 3, 1, 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\n\n```\nResult: 2013101\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2013101.",

In base 4, this is 0 with a carry of 1.\n   - Next column:\n     - 0 (from 11002) + 1 (from 30213012) + 1 (carry) = 2. Write down 2.\n   - Next column:\n     - 0 (from 11002) + 3 (from 30213012) = 3.

In base 4, 6 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 2 (since 6 = 4 + 2).\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 3. Write down 3.\n   - **Next column**: 1 + 0 = 1. Write down 1.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 3 = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1. Write down 1.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 2 = 4. In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 (carry 1) and 1 (since 4 = 4 + 0).\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 (carry 1) and 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Leftmost column**: 0 + 1 (carry) = 1. Write down 1.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the leftmost to the rightmost, we have: 1 (from the last column), 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```\n   30210103\n+  1203023\n-----------\n  11013122\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11013122.",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - \\(1 + 2 = 3\\) (in base 4, this is still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(3 + 0 = 3\\) (still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\) (in base 4, this is \\(10\\), so we write down \\(0\\) and carry over \\(1\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(0 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 3\\) (still \\(3\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(2 + 0 = 2\\) (still \\(2\\))\n   - Next column:\n     - \\(1 + 0 = 1\\) (still \\(1\\))\n   - Finally, the leftmost column:\n     - \\(1 + 0 = 1\\) (still \\(1\\))\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we combine the results from each column:\n   - From the rightmost column to the left: \\(1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3\\)\n\nSo, the final result in base 4 is \\(123303\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 123303.",

However, we can also add directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column**: Starting from the rightmost column, we will add the digits together, carrying over if the sum exceeds 3 (since we are in base 4).\n\n   - Rightmost column: \\(0 + 3 = 3\\) (write down 3)\n   - Next column: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) (5 in base 4 is \\(1\\) carry \\(1\\), so write down \\(1\\) and carry \\(1\\))\n   - Next column: \\(2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3\\) (write down 3)\n   - Next column: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) (write down 2)\n   - Next column: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\) (write down 1)\n   - Leftmost column: \\(1\\) (write down 1)\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now we combine the results from each column:\n\n```\n   1230\n+ 111023\n---------\n  112313\n```\n\nThus, the result of \\(1230 + 111023\\) in base 4 is \\(112313\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 112313.",

If the sum of two digits exceeds 3, we carry over to the next column.\n\nLet's break down the addition step by step:\n\n1. **Align the numbers**:\n   ```\n       33022230\n   +      1122\n   ```\n\n2. **Add from the rightmost column to the left**:\n   - **Column 0**: 0 + 2 = 2 (no carry)\n   - **Column 1**: 3 + 2 = 5. Since 5 in base 4 is 1 with a carry of 1 (5 - 4 = 1, carry 1).\n   - **Column 2**: 2 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 4. Since 4 in base 4 is 0 with a carry of 1 (4 - 4 = 0, carry 1).\n   - **Column 3**: 2 + 1 (carry) = 3 (no carry).\n   - **Column 4**: 0 + 0 = 0 (no carry).\n   - **Column 5**: 2 + 0 = 2 (no carry).\n   - **Column 6**: 3 + 0 = 3 (no carry).\n   - **Column 7**: 3 + 0 = 3 (no carry).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the rightmost column to the left, we have: 3 (Column 7), 3 (Column 6), 2 (Column 5), 0 (Column 4), 3 (Column 3), 0 (Column 2), 1 (Column 1), 2 (Column 0).\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```\nResult: 33020212\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 33020212.",

Since 5 in base 4 is 1 with a carry of 1 (5 = 4 + 1), we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3 (no carry)\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 3 = 5. Again, we have 5 in base 4, which is 1 with a carry of 1. We write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\n3. **Final carry**: Since we have a carry of 1 left after adding the leftmost column, we write it down.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n```\n   2220110\n+  3033201\n-----------\n  11113111\n```\n\nThus, the final result of the addition is **11113111** in base 4.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 11113111.",

However, we will perform the addition directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column from right to left**:\n   - Start from the rightmost column:\n     - \\( 1 + 0 = 1 \\) (base 4)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\) (base 4)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\) (base 4)\n   - Next column:\n     - \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) (base 4). Since 5 is greater than 4, we convert it:\n       - \\( 5 \\div 4 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n       - Write down \\( 1 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\) to the next column.\n   - Next column (including carry):\n     - \\( 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \\) (base 4). Again, convert:\n       - \\( 4 \\div 4 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n       - Write down \\( 0 \\) and carry over \\( 1 \\) to the next column.\n   - Next column (including carry):\n     - \\( 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 \\) (base 4)\n\n4. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the leftmost column to the rightmost, we have:\n     - \\( 1 \\) (carry)\n     - \\( 3 \\)\n     - \\( 0 \\)\n     - \\( 1 \\)\n     - \\( 3 \\)\n     - \\( 1 \\)\n\nSo, the final result in base 4 is \\( 130311 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 130311.",

The steps described contain arithmetic errors, particularly when handling the carry operation.\n\n3. **The model's output process broke down.** - There is no indication that the output process broke down; the model produced a complete answer, though incorrect.\n\n4. **Other reasons.** - This could apply to many ambiguous issues but does not specifically address the arithmetic error present.\n\nGiven the context, I conclude that the most plausible reason for the failure to provide the correct answer is:\n\n**2.

However, we will perform the addition directly in base 4.\n\n3. **Add column by column**: Start from the rightmost column and move left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n   - **Rightmost column**: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\). In base 4, \\(4\\) is represented as \\(10\\), so we write down \\(0\\) and carry over \\(1\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 3\\). Write down \\(3\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Write down \\(2\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(0 + 0 = 0\\). Write down \\(0\\).\n   - **Next column**: \\(3 + 0 = 3\\). Write down \\(3\\).\n   - **Leftmost column**: \\(3\\) remains as \\(3\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Now, we combine the results from each column:\n\n```\n   301112\n+    1212\n---------\n   320203\n```\n\nThus, the result of \\(1212 + 301112\\) in base 4 is \\(320203\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is 320203.",

In base 4, the sum of \\(2 + 2\\) correctly results in \\(4\\), which should be written as \\(0\\) with a carry of \\(1\\), leading us down the right path in the calculations.\n   \n2. However, as we further examine the addition of \\(1 + 1\\) with a carry of \\(1\\), the presence of the carry was accounted for correctly, but the subsequent additions appear to have gone amiss. The model's mention of \\(3\\) as written down in the second column and later steps appear to lack consistency with base 4 addition.\n\n3. Notably, the final combined result, \\(320203\\), diverges from the ground truth answer \\(302330\\), suggesting a mistake in the later stages of the addition process or during the carry-over steps.\n\nThus, the model's calculations broke down as it failed to accurately manage the base 4 addition throughout the process, resulting in the miscalculated output.\n\nTherefore, the error analysis reason is:\n3.

In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 2. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 3 = 5. In base 4, this is again 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 5. Again, this is 1 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 0 = 3. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 0 = 2. No carry.\n   - **Leftmost column**: 2 + 0 = 2. No carry.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the rightmost column to the leftmost, we have: 2 (from the leftmost), 2, 3, 1 (from the next), 1 (from the next), 2, 1 (from the next), and 1 (from the rightmost).\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n```\nResult: 2211311\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 2211311.",

In base 4, 6 is represented as 1 with a carry of 2 (since 6 = 4 + 2).\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 1 + 1 = 3. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 3 = 3. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 0 + 0 = 0. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 2 + 3 = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Next column**: 1 (carry) + 0 + 1 = 2. No carry.\n   - **Next column**: 3 + 2 = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Leftmost column**: 1 (carry) + 0 = 1. No carry.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the rightmost column to the leftmost, we have: 1 (carry) + 1 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 1120031.\n\nThus, the final result of the addition is:\n\n**Answer: The answer is 1120031.**",

In base 4, 6 is represented as 1 with a carry of 2 (since 6 = 4 + 2).\n   - **Fourth column**: 1 + 1 + 2 (carry) = 4. In base 4, 4 is represented as 0 with a carry of 1.\n   - **Fifth column**: 3 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 7. In base 4, 7 is represented as 1 with a carry of 3 (since 7 = 4 + 3).\n   - **Sixth column**: 0 + 2 + 3 (carry) = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Seventh column**: 1 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 5. In base 4, 5 is represented as 1 with a carry of 1 (since 5 = 4 + 1).\n   - **Eighth column**: 0 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 3.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - From the rightmost column to the leftmost, we have:\n     - 3 (from the eighth column)\n     - 1 (from the seventh column)\n     - 1 (from the sixth column)\n     - 0 (from the fifth column)\n     - 1 (from the fourth column)\n     - 2 (from the third column)\n     - 1 (from the second column)\n     - 1 (from the first column)\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n**Final result**: 31120111 in base 4.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: The answer is 31120111.",
